        LYRICS
        <blockquote><pre>
        Lazy Sunday, wake up in the late afternoon
        Call Parnell just to see how he's doin'
        Hello? What up, Parns?
        Yo, Samberg, what's crackin'?
        You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Narnia

        Man, it's happenin'
        But first my hunger pangs are stickin' like duct tape
        Let's hit up Magnolia and mack on some cupcakes
        No doubt, that bakery's got all the bomb frostings
        I love those cupcakes like McAdams loves Gosling

        Two, no, six, no, twelve, bakers' dozen
        I told you that I'm crazy for these cupcakes, cousin
        Yo, where's the movie playin'? Up on west side, dude
        Well, let's hit up Yahoo Maps to find the dopest route

        I prefer MapQuest, that's a good one too
        Google maps is the best, true that, double true
        Yo, sixty eight to Broadway, step on it, sucka
        Whatcha wanna do Chris? Snack attack, muthafucka

        The Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        Yes, the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        We love the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        Pass the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia

        Yo, stop at the deli, the theater's overpriced
        You got the back pack? Gonna pack it up nice
        Don't want security to get suspicious
        MrPibb and Red Vines equals crazy delicious

        Yo, reach in my pocket, pull out some dough
        Girl acted like she'd never seen a ten befo'
        It's all about the Hamilton's, baby
        Throw the snacks in the bag
        And I'm a ghost like Swayze

        Roll up to the theater, ticket buyin'
        What we're handlin', you can call us Aaron Burr
        From the way we're droppin' Hamilton's
        Now parked in our seats, movie trivia's da illest
        Whose "Friends" alum starred in films with Bruce Willis?

        We answered so fast, it was scary
        Everyone stared in awe when we screamed, Matthew Perry
        Now quiet in the theater or it's gonna get tragic
        We're about to get taken to a dream world of magic

        The Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        Yes, the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        We love the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia
        Pass the Chronicwhatcles of Narnia </pre></blockquote>
